## Fun fact
This project was made in August 2024 in around 6 hours of coding, debugging, and researching. It was my first project using SDL2.

## Building from source
It was developed and tested only on Windows 10. Linux and macOS are unsupported, forks that add compatibility to those OSes are welcomed.

The `MinGW-w64` toolchain was used to compile and test the application. Use `mingw32-make` while in the src folder to build. No additional dependencies are required.

## Libraries used
